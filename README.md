## Overview

The **Food Tracking System** is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline food delivery logistics using modern web development practices. Built on **Laravel**, it integrates **real-time shipping cost calculation**, **multi-gateway payment processing**, and an intuitive **Filament-powered admin dashboard**.

This system ensures extensibility through architectural patterns like the **Factory Design Pattern**, enabling seamless integration of new payment gateways without modifying existing logic.

   - PayPal
   - Cash on Delivery

Changes are applied instantly across the checkout flow.

> ðŸ’¡ Powered by the **Factory Design Pattern**, this system allows easy addition of new payment gateways in the future.

---

## Factory Design Pattern Architecture

To support dynamic switching between payment gateways, we use the **Factory Design Pattern**, which decouples payment logic from the client code.

### Class Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class PaymentGatewayFactory {
        +makePaymentGateway(string $type): PaymentGateway
    }

    class PaymentGateway {
        <<interface>>
        +process(array $data): mixed
    }

    class StripeGateway {
        +process(array $data): mixed
    }

    class PayPalGateway {
        +process(array $data): mixed
    }

    class CashOnDeliveryGateway {
        +process(array $data): mixed
    }

    PaymentGatewayFactory --> PaymentGateway : returns
    StripeGateway --|> PaymentGateway
    PayPalGateway --|> PaymentGateway
    CashOnDeliveryGateway --|> PaymentGateway
```

---

###  How It Works

1. **Client Code** calls `PaymentGatewayFactory::makePaymentGateway($type)` with a type like `'stripe'`, `'paypal'`, or `'cash_on_delivery'`.
2. The **Factory** inspects the type and returns an instance of the corresponding **gateway class**.
3. Each gateway implements the same interface (`PaymentGateway`) and provides its own logic inside the `process()` method.
4. The client can now safely call `process()` without knowing which specific gateway is being used.
